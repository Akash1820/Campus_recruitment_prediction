# Campus Recruitment Prediction - Machine Learning Report
1. Introduction
The placement of students is one of the most critical objectives for educational institutions. The reputation and yearly admissions of an institution depend heavily on its placement success rate. To improve placement rates, institutions strive to strengthen their placement departments. This project aims to predict whether a student will be recruited in campus placements based on various academic and professional factors present in the dataset.
2. Dataset Overview
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggleâ€™s Campus Recruitment Prediction dataset. It contains various academic, demographic, and employment-related features of students to predict their recruitment status.
Features in the Dataset:
sl_no: Serial number (not relevant for prediction)
ssc_p: Senior Secondary (10th Grade) percentage
ssc_b: Board of Education for SSC (Central/State)
hsc_p: Higher Secondary (12th Grade) percentage
hsc_b: Board of Education for HSC (Central/State)
hsc_s: Specialization in Higher Secondary (Science, Commerce, Arts)
degree_p: Degree Percentage
degree_t: Degree Type (Field of Study: Comm & Mgmt, Sci & Tech, Others)
workex: Work Experience (Yes/No)
etest_p: Employability Test Percentage
specialisation: MBA Specialization (Mkt&Fin, Mkt&HR)
mba_p: MBA Percentage
status: Placement Status (Placed/Not Placed) - Target Variable
salary: Salary offered (dropped for prediction purposes)
3. Data Preprocessing
To ensure that the dataset is suitable for machine learning models, the following preprocessing steps were performed:
Handling Missing Values:
Checked for missing values using .isnull().sum()
No missing values were found, so no imputation was required.
Dropping Irrelevant Columns:
The columns sl_no and salary were removed as they are not useful for predictions.
Encoding Categorical Variables:
Categorical variables were converted into numerical format using LabelEncoder.
The following features were encoded:
ssc_b, hsc_b, hsc_s, degree_t, specialisation, workex, and status
Feature Scaling:
Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler to ensure uniformity in model training.
Train-Test Split:
The dataset was split into 70% training and 30% testing using train_test_split with a random_state=42 for reproducibility.
4. Model Selection & Training
To identify the best predictive model, five different machine learning algorithms were implemented:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Each model was trained using the training dataset (X_train, y_train) and evaluated on the test dataset.
5. Model Evaluation
Each model was assessed using multiple metrics:
Accuracy Score
Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
Confusion Matrix

6. Conclusion & Key Takeaways
Findings:
Decision Tree Classifier provided the best accuracy among individual models (84.6%).
The Voting Classifier further improved accuracy to 87.5%, demonstrating the strength of ensemble learning.
Feature analysis showed that degree_p, ssc_p, and mba_p were the most important predictors for campus placement.
Improvements can be made by implementing hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV) and trying Boosting models like XGBoost or Gradient Boosting.


Future Enhancements:
Implement deep learning models (Neural Networks) for further improvements.
Integrate additional datasets for more robust predictions.
Develop a web-based UI for real-time student placement predictions.
